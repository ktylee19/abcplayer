Feedback
--------

You guys did a great job overall. Your original design document was
lacking somewhat and you didn't quite play voices correctly (and
crashed on tuples), but mostly your code was very functional and very
readable. I really liked your package hierarchy and general
organization; it was very clear to me what would need to be changed to
add functionality.

I also really appreciated the entire separate class of tests, all of
which very well-documented. The coverage of the tests was also very
impressive. One thing that you could improve is to have actual
end-to-end tests, rather than just listening-based tests.
